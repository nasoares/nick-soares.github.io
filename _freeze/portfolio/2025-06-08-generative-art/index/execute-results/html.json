This piece uses a plankton monitoring time series as the underlying dataset, from which transformations, aesthetic manipulations, and layering result in a swirling assortment of points and rays akin to a solar system. This piece evokes the continuum between microscopic and macroscopic, the inherent link between the smallest and largest scales accessible to human observation.\n\n### Code Choices\n\nUsing `coord_polar()` changes the structure of the x-axis so all the data spirals around a central point. Multiple data transformations (such as log scaling) are used in the layered `geom_bar()` and `geom_point()` calls to space out the data so it has a characteristic cosmic feel, like asteroid belts encircling the sun.\n\n# Gallery Entry #2\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n#generate color palettes\n\nsample_canva <- function(seed = NULL) {\n  if(!is.null(seed)) set.seed(seed)\n  sample(ggthemes::canva_palettes, 1)[[1]]\n}\n\n#create a canvas\n\nx_coords <- seq(from = 0, to = 1, length.out = 800)\ny_coords <- seq(from = 0, to = 1, length.out = 800)\ncanvas <- long_grid(x = x_coords, y = y_coords) \n\n#add some generated \"paint\" to the canvas\n\ncanvas <- canvas |>\n  mutate(paint = fracture(\n            noise = gen_simplex,\n            x = x,\n            y = y,\n            octaves = 20,\n            fractal = fbm,\n            seed = 29))\n\n#defining the shape of a nonagon to add some structure/geometry to the fractal chaos\n\ntheta <- (0:9) * pi / 4.5\nnonagon <- tibble(\n  x = sin(theta),\n  y = cos(theta)\n)\n\nnonagon_scale <- nonagon |>\n  mutate(x_scale = x/4+0.5, \n         y_scale = y/4+0.5)\n\n#putting them all together\n\nfractal_plot <- ggplot() +\n  geom_raster(data = canvas, \n              aes(x, y, fill = paint), \n              show.legend = FALSE) +\n  scale_x_continuous(expand = c(0, 0)) +\n  scale_y_continuous(expand = c(0, 0)) +\n  scale_fill_gradientn(colours = sample_canva(seed = 42)) +\n  geom_polygon(data = nonagon_scale,\n               aes(x_scale, y_scale), \n               colour = \"white\", \n               fill = NA, \n               show.legend = FALSE) +\n  geom_polygon(data = nonagon_scale,\n               aes(x_scale-0.1, y_scale-0.1), \n               colour = \"white\", \n               fill = NA, \n               show.legend = FALSE) +\n  geom_polygon(data = nonagon_scale,\n               aes(x_scale+0.1, y_scale+0.1), \n               colour = \"white\", \n               fill = NA, \n               show.legend = FALSE) +\n  coord_equal() + \n  theme_void()\n\nfractal_plot\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/building-art-two-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n## Title: Nebulagon\n\n### Dramatic Description\n\nA nebula at the outskirts of a distant galaxy. Within the gas and cosmic dust, a set of rings stand out, their seemingly-purposeful angularity denoting intelligent design amidst chaos. Perhaps leftover structures from an ancient, insterstellar race? Do you dare approach?\n\n### Code Choices\n\nThe `sample_canva()` function generates a random palette that is replicable if we set a \"seed\". The `fracture()` function used when \"painting the canvas\" takes the noise generated using `gen_simplex()` and repeatedly applies it at different frequencies. By setting \"octaves\" to 20, the generator and fractal functions iterate over the algorithm 20 times. The nonagon structure is first built as a tibble, then rescaled using some simple transformations so it appears at the center of the final plot. The final image brings all elements together by layering polygons on top of a raster base.\n\n",
